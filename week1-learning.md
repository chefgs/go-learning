# Week 1 of Learning Go: From First Principles to Core Syntax

## ðŸ“š Why I'm Learning Go

As someone working in DevOps and automation, Go keeps showing up in tools I use daily (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker). Itâ€™s fast, efficient, and increasingly the language of systems engineering. My goal? Learn it the right way: **from first principles**.

I dedicated this first week to mastering the **core syntax**, understanding memory handling, types, control structures, and common patterns that make Go elegant and powerful.

## ðŸ”¹ Packages and Imports

- Every Go program starts with a `` declaration.
- Imports can be **factored** like this:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "math/rand"
)
```

- Go enforces good style: exported identifiers begin with **uppercase letters** (e.g., `Pi` from `math`), while lowercase identifiers are unexported.

## ðŸ”¹ Functions and Return Values

### Function with multiple arguments:

```go
func add(x, y, c int) int {
  return x + y + c
}
```

### Function with multiple return values:

```go
func swap(x, y, z string) (string, string, string) {
  return x, y, z
}
```

### Named return values (naked return):

```go
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
  x = sum * 4 / 9
  y = sum - x
  return
}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Variables and Constants

- Variables can be declared with `var`, or using short declarations `:=` inside functions.
- Uninitialized variables get **zero values**.

```go
var i int
j := 3.2
```

### Constants:

```go
const Pi = 3.14
const Truth = true
```

### Big/Small Constants:

```go
const (
  Big = 1 << 100
  Small = Big >> 99
)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Type Inference and Basic Types

- Go supports strong **type inference**:

```go
v := 42 // inferred as int
```

- Basic types include: `int`, `float64`, `bool`, `string`, `complex128`, `rune`, and `byte`

```go
var (
  ToBe bool = false
  z complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
  s string = "hello"
)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Control Structures: for, if, defer

### For loop:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  fmt.Println(i)
}
```

### While-like for loop:

```go
for sum < 1000 {
  sum += sum
}
```

### If with short statement:

```go
if v := math.Pow(2, 3); v < 10 {
  return v
}
```

### Defer:

```go
defer fmt.Println("world")
fmt.Println("hello")
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pointers

```go
p := &i   // assign pointer
*p = 21   // dereference to change value
```

In Go, a pointer is a variable that **stores the memory address of another variable**. You create a pointer using the `&` (address-of) operator, and access or modify the value it points to using the `*` (dereference) operator.

- `p := &i` means pointer `p` now holds the address of variable `i`.
- `*p = 21` modifies the value stored at that address, effectively updating `i`.

Go supports safe and simple pointer usage without pointer arithmetic (like in C), making memory management more controlled while still powerful.

Pointers are especially useful when:

- Passing large structs or data to functions without copying
- Modifying values inside functions
- Sharing data across function calls or components

---

## ðŸ”¹ Structs and Pointer to Structs

```go
type Vertex struct {
  X, Y int
}

v := Vertex{1, 2}
p := &v
p.X = 1000
```

> Accessing struct fields via pointer doesn't require explicit dereferencing.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Arrays and Slices

### Array:

```go
var a [2]string
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
```

### Slices:

```go
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
s := primes[1:4] // slice with elements 3, 5, 7
```

- Slices reference the underlying array. Mutating one slice affects others sharing the same data.

### Slice literals:

```go
q := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
r := []bool{true, false, true}
```

### Slice defaults:

```go
s = s[1:4]
s = s[:2]
s = s[1:]
```

---

## ðŸš€ Final Thoughts

This week, I went from zero to solid on Go fundamentals:

- How Go handles variables, memory, and structures
- Writing functions with multiple returns
- Using slices effectively
- Understanding package structure and scoping rules

In **Week 2**, Iâ€™ll continue building my core knowledge and, if all goes well, start exploring **API development using **``, followed by **TDD practices** in Go.

> Learning from first principles has been the most rewarding part. Instead of skipping ahead to frameworks, I'm understanding the "why" behind the language.

Let me know if youâ€™re also learning Go â€” happy to exchange notes!
